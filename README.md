# React Food Order Application
React project for ordering meals. Meal items are fetched from firebase database, and user can select meal he wants and amount of them. By clicking on Orders button modal pops-up with selected meals, their amount and total price. On the next step by clicking Order button, another modal with form for credit card shows up and the most basic validation is added. If everything is alright, meals are ordered and form informations are saved, just as ordered meals.
